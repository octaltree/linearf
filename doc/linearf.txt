==============================================================================
INSTALLATION	*linearf-install*

First, install the plugins and sources locally. If you use dein as your package
manager, it will look like this.
>
  call dein#add('octaltree/linearf')
  call dein#add('octaltree/linearf-my-flavors')
<
Then build your own fuzzy finder.
>
  lua require('linearf').recipe.sources = {}
  lua require('linearf').recipe.matchers = {}
  lua require('linearf').recipe.converters = {}
  lua require('linearf').build()
<
One build is required per recipe change.

==============================================================================
USAGE	*linearf-usage*

After the build is complete, initialize it with the UI module.
>
  lua require('linearf').init(require('linearf-vanilla').new())
<
After initialize, you can use the global variable `linearf` and execute it.
>
  lua linearf.run('', {})
<
You can set up frequently used scenarios in advance.
>
  lua require('linearf').senarios = {
      \     simple = {
      \         linearf = {
      \             source = 'simple',
      \             matcher = 'substring'
      \         }
      \     },
      \     osstr = {
      \         linearf = {
      \             source = 'osstr',
      \             matcher = 'substring'
      \         }
      \     }
      \ }
  lua linearf.run('simple')
  lua linearf.run('simple', {})

MOTIVATION	*linearf-motivation*

There are many fuzzy finders in vim: CtrlP, LeaderF, denite, telescope, clap,
fzf, skim, fzf-preview, candle, etc. However, there were nothing that that had
the feel of vim and the speed of native fzf, so I decided to make one.

I want to write in another language because vim script is slow, but I have to
consider the cost of moving data to vim. After considering rpc, dynamic
libraries, and wasm for speed and vim compability, I chose to load dynamic
libraries written by rust via lua.
